      Hello everyone, my name is Shaneel Kumar and I have lived in Wellington for over 17 years. I was an Architectural Gradiate prior to coming to Dev Academy and have been interested in programming since my days at university. My goal is to find a career that gives me agency to explore and be creative without a lot of constraints and unfortunately, architecture was not that (for me). I have since set my sights on web development because it is such a diverse field that I find incredibly creative! There is definitely a perfect role out there for me and I can't wait to get out into the real world with the skills I will learn at Dev Academy.
